# Welcome to the stank-free Warhammer 40k resource pack for Tabletop Simulator!

This pack is designed for use with the FTC Map Base. Its purpose is to make it easier to play 40k on Tabletop Sim in the following ways:
  1) Provide a set of maps with consistent and easy-to-read terrain labels
  2) Help players quickly determine which maps will work for which missions (based on the mission objective marker placement and the map terrain placement)
  3) Allow players to see a large preview of a map before loading it in so that they don't have to load a map in order to determine whether they want to use it

Items 2 and 3 are accomplished by means of the Map Index, which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16q2N1kH5Qmx_2X1uieNEGSmBKINaIf1I2aHZrRfLB6M/edit?usp=sharing) if you want to use it as a standalone reference. However, this pack also includes a tablet object that can be easily loaded into your table and will display the index in-game so you don't have to alt-tab out of TTS. This is the preferred method of accessing the Map Index.
