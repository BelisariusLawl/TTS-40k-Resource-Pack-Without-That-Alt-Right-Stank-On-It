# Welcome to the stank-free Warhammer 40k resource pack for Tabletop Simulator!

<b>NOTE: As of right now this pack only includes Strike Force (60" x 44") maps. Maps for Combat Patrol, Incursion, and Onslaught missions will be added soon.</b>

## Intro
This pack is designed for use with the FTC Map Base. Its purpose is to make it easier to play 40k on Tabletop Sim in the following ways:
  1) Provide a set of maps with consistent and easy-to-read terrain labels
  2) Help players quickly determine which maps will work for which missions (based on the mission objective marker placement and the map terrain placement)
  3) Allow players to see a large preview of a map before loading it in so that they don't have to load a map in order to determine whether they want to use it

Items 2 and 3 are accomplished by means of the Map Index, which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16q2N1kH5Qmx_2X1uieNEGSmBKINaIf1I2aHZrRfLB6M/edit?usp=sharing) if you want to use it as a standalone reference. However, this pack also includes a tablet object that can be easily loaded into your table and will display the index in-game so you don't have to alt-tab out of TTS. This is the preferred method of accessing the Map Index.

## How to use this resource pack

In order to use this pack, you'll want to have a 40k map base mod for Tabletop Simulator. I highly recommend [the FTC 40k 9th Edition Map Base](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2121424734). Everything in this pack is intended to be loaded into your map base of choice using TTS's Additive Load capability.

To access the maps in this pack within TTS, you'll need to add them to your TTS saves. To do so, download this repository as a ZIP archive and extract it. Then copy or move the Map Pack folder directly into your TTS "Saves" folder. On a Windows machine, this generally means putting the Map Pack folder in My Documents>My Games>Tabletop Simulator>Saves".

Once you've got these two components, load up your map base in TTS and follow these steps:

  - Set and confirm your table size (you can do this later, but no real reason not to do it now)
  - If you don't already have a mission selected, select or roll for one as necessary.
  - Using the Games menu, load in the Map Index Tablet save via additive load. You can either navigate to this in the Map Pack folder in your Saves or just search for "map index" in the search bar to go straight to it.
  - Click 'OK' on the prompt that says that TTS wants to open a URL, so that it can load the Map Index
  - Use the Map Index to determine which map you want to load. For more information on how to use the index, see "Using the Map Index" below.
  - Delete the Map Index Tablet or move it off the play space to some other part of the map base.
  - Using the Games menu again, search for the map you selected via the search bar and additive load it into the table.

## The Map Index

The Map Index is a tool for picking maps that will work for a particular mission. It holds a list of which maps are compatible with each Eternal War and Grand Tournament mission, based on whether the map has any terrain features in the places where the objective markers for that mission should be placed. If there are terrain features in the way of the objective marker locations, the map is considered to be incompatible with that mission. Since Crusade missions do not have set placements for objective markers, they are not included in the Map Index. Keep in mind that just because a map is listed as compatible with a certain mission does not mean it's necessarily a good map for that mission - it just means you could use it without having to move any terrain features around to accomodate the objective markers.

### Using the Map Index

As mentioned above, the Map Index can be used either as a [standalone google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16q2N1kH5Qmx_2X1uieNEGSmBKINaIf1I2aHZrRfLB6M/edit?usp=sharing) or by loading in the Map Index Tablet in TTS. I recommend the latter.

To use the index, you'll need to know which mission you're playing. Once you do, simply click the filter button (funnel icon) in the menus at the top of the sheet and select your mission. The list of maps will be filtered to only show maps that are compatible with that mission.

The map names in the leftmost column are all links to pictures of the maps themselves so that you can preview each compatible map. To go back to the list of compatible maps from any preview image, use the back button (left arrow) on the tablet. The Map Index will automatically reapply the same filter you had, though it may take a second to do so. While unfortunately the filtering on the Map Index will only work for the person who spawned in the tablet - the other player(s) will not be able to see the filtered list - the preview images should display for all players. This will hopefully make it easy for players to decide which map to use without having to load and delete several maps, since it provides a much clearer view of the map than the thumbnails that TTS shows.
